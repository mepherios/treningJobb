Introduction to Color
CSS supports a wide variety of colors. These include named colors, like blue, black, and limegreen, 
along with colors described by a numeric value. 
Using a numeric system allows us to take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that browsers support. 
In this lesson, we’re going to explore all the color options CSS offers.

Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:

Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness
We’ll learn about and explore the benefits of each of these in-depth. 
Using only named colors, you may feel like you’re picking labeled crayons out of a box. 
By the end of this lesson, you’ll feel like a painter mixing paints on a palette.

Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
The RGB color scheme is convenient because it’s very close to how computers represent colors internally. 
There’s another equally powerful system in CSS called the hue-saturation-lightness color scheme, abbreviated as HSL.

hsl = hue=farge i fargehjulet, saturation = styrken av fargen/renhet, nærmere 100% er mer farge, nærmere 0 er gråere.
l=lightness hvor lys/mørk denne er.
