Review

Congratulations! In this lesson, you learned about browser compatibility and how to resolve issues that occur when websites are rendered across different browsers and their various versions. Letâ€™s take a moment to review what we learned:

    We can check whether a CSS feature is available on specific browsers using tools like caniuse.com.
    Browsers have default styles which we can check using resources like browserdefaultstyles.com.
    We sometimes need to use browser-specific prefixes, especially for new CSS features.
    Polyfills provide a way to support newer web features on older browsers.

You are well on your way to developing amazing websites that work consistently on various browsers and devices!
