Grid Essentials
Grid Items

In this lesson, we have learned how to define a grid container. 
When explicitly defining a grid, you have to declare the quantity of rows and columns and their respective sizes.

In all of our examples, the items placed in the grid have always taken up exactly one square. 
This does not always need to be the case; 
we can drastically change the look of our grid by making grid items take up more than one row and one column. 
You can see this in the diagram to the right. Items A, B, C, and E span more than one row!

In the following exercises, you will learn CSS properties that will affect the size of the grid items and where they are displayed
 on the page. By manipulating both the parent and the child elements, we can create beautiful layouts with ease.

Letâ€™s start exploring grid items!
