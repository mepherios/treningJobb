Duration

To create a simple transition in CSS, we must specify two of the four aspects:

    The property that we want to transition.
    The duration of the transition.

a {
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 1s;
}


# Styrer hvordan timing blir gitt.
transition-timing-function: linear;

transition-delay: 750ms; 
gir delay på når transition blir gjort.

shorthand.

transition-property: color;
transition-duration: 1.5s;
transition-timing-function: linear;
transition-delay: 0.5s;

transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s;


combinasjoner. 

transition: color 1s linear,
font-size 750ms ease-in 100ms;


.button span,
.button div,
.button i {
    transition: width 750ms ease-in 200ms,
    left 500ms ease-out 450ms,
    font-size 950ms linear;
}

# kombinasjoner for flere forskjellige buttons typer osv.

# Gir universal oppførsel for alle transition elementer.
transition: all 1.5s linear 0,5s;

.button span, 
.button div, 
.button i {
  transition: all 1.2s ease-out 0.2s;
}




Review

CSS Transitions are a powerful tool for providing visual feedback to users. We’ve learned a lot about transitions, so let’s review:

CSS Transitions have 4 components:

    A property that will transition.
    The duration which describes how long the transition takes.
    The delay to pause before the transition will take place.
    The timing function that describes the transition’s acceleration.

A simple transition can be described with a property and a duration, which can be written like this:

transition-property: color;
transition-duration: 1s;

Many properties’ state changes can be transitioned, including color, background color, font size, width, and height. all is also a valid transition property that causes every changing property to transition.

The shorthand property transition can be used to describe all four components of a transition at once. By using the comma (,) operator, many transitions can be described in one CSS rule.

If you want to learn more about CSS Transitions, we recommend MDN’s Using CSS Transitions doc.
